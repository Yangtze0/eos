| Authority		  |          	   | An abstract of permissions that represent how permissions are organized in reality that are bound to an individual or groups of individuals |
| Block           | Blk            | A confirmable unit of the Blockchain. Each block contains zero or more Transactions, as well as a cryptographic connection to all prior blocks. When a block becomes "irreversibly confirmed" it's because a supermajority of Block Producers have agreed that the given Block contains correct Transactions. Once a Block is irreversibly confirmed, it becomes a permanent part of the immutable Blockchain. |
| DAC             |                | Decentralized Autonomous Collective, or Decentralized Autonomous Corporation. Described in detail here (need link). |
| DAO             |                | Decentralized Autonomous Organization. |
| DPoS            |                | Delegated Proof of Stake. Also, "Democracy as Proof of Stake." DPoS is one of a collection of consensus algorithms, i.e. methods by which block producers can agree (reach consensus) on which transactions and which blocks are "real" and should be confirmed and treated as irreversible. |
| Key pair		  | keys		   | A public key and its corresponding private key |
| larimer         |                | 1/1000 of an EOS (token) `0.0001 EOS` |
| Master Password | 			   | The password used to to unlock (decrypt) a wallet file |
| Message         | Msg            | A change to the Blockchain. One or more messages make up a Transaction. |   
| Oracle          |                | "An oracle, in the context of blockchains and smart contracts, is an agent that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used by smart contracts." *[Source](https://blockchainhub.net/blockchain-oracles/)* |
| Permission      |				   | A weighted security mechanism that determines whether or not a message is properly authorized by evaluating its signature(s) authority |
| Private Key	  |    			   | A secret key used to sign transactions | 
| Public Key	  | pub key		   | A publicly available key that is transmitted alongside a transaction |
| Smart Contract  |                | A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. |
| Transaction     | Tx, Txn        | A complete all-or-nothing change to the Blockchain. A combination of one or more Messages. Usually, the execution of a Smart Contract.
| Wallet		  |  			   | An encrypted file generated and/or managed by a client (for example, `eosc`) that manages private keys and facilitates the signing of transactions in a secure manner. Wallets may be in a locked or unlocked state. |
| Witness         | block producer | The node that is currently taking its turn producing the "right now" block for the blockchain. Or, a member of the group of nodes who have been elected to take such turns. Synonymous with 'block producer' |
